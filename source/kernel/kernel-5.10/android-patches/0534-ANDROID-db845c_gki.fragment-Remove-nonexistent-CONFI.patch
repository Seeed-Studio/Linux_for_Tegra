Subject: [PATCH 534/830] ANDROID: db845c_gki.fragment: Remove nonexistent
 CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DISABLE_GADGET_SG value
X-NVConfidentiality: public

The CONFIG_USB_DWC3_DISABLE_GADGET_SG value was added to the
db845c_gki.fragment before it was merged to support a patch that
ended up being replaced with a upstream solution.

However, the config was not cleared out of the
db845c_gki.fragment before it was submitted.

This patch simply removes the assignment of the non-existant
config
