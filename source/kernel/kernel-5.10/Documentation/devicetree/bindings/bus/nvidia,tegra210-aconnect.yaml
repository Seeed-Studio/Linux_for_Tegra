title: NVIDIA Tegra ACONNECT Bus DT bindings

description: The Tegra ACONNECT bus is an AXI switch which is used to connnect
  various components inside the Audio Processing Engine (APE). All CPU accesses
  to the APE subsystem go through the ACONNECT via an APB to AXI wrapper. All
  devices accessed via the ACONNNECT are described by child-nodes.
