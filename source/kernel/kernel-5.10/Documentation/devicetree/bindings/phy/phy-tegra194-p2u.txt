NVIDIA Tegra194 & Tegra234 P2U binding

Tegra194 has two PHY bricks namely HSIO (High Speed IO) and NVHS (NVIDIA High
Speed) each interfacing with 12 and 8 P2U instances respectively.
Tegra234 has three PHY bricks namely HSIO (High Speed IO) and NVHS (NVIDIA High
Speed) and GBE (Gigabit Ethernet) each interfacing with 8 P2U instances
respectively.
A P2U instance is a glue logic between Synopsys DesignWare Core PCIe IP's PIPE
interface and PHY of HSIO/NVHS/GBE bricks. Each P2U instance represents one PCIe
lane.

Required properties:
- compatible: For Tegra19x, must contain "nvidia,tegra194-p2u".
	      For Tegra23x, must contain "nvidia,tegra234-p2u".
- reg: Should be the physical address space and length of respective each P2U
       instance.
- reg-names: Must include the entry "ctl".

Optional properties:
- nvidia,skip-sz-protect-en: This is a boolean property and needs to be present
    if the platform is using SRNS clocking configuration and the number of
    retimers present between root port and endpoint are two.
    This is applicable only for T234 and not for T194 as it doesn't
    support SRNS configuration. In T234 also, it is applicable only for the
    two retimers case and not for the single retimer case.

Required properties for PHY port node:
- #phy-cells: Defined by generic PHY bindings.  Must be 0.

Refer to phy/phy-bindings.txt for the generic PHY binding properties.

Example:

p2u_hsio_0: phy@3e10000 {
	compatible = "nvidia,tegra194-p2u";
	reg = <0x03e10000 0x10000>;
	reg-names = "ctl";

	#phy-cells = <0>;
};
